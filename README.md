## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to my network reconnaissance (Recon) projects, focusing primarily on vulnerability scanning, subdomain enumeration, and network security assessments. My work revolves around identifying potential security flaws using industry-standard tools and techniques. Whether you're a fellow researcher or an interested collaborator, this workspace reflects my ongoing journey in network security and vulnerability research.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive reconnaissance tools and scripts for network security research.
- Vulnerability assessments based on **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** databases.
- Utilization of **Shodan** and other intelligence-gathering tools for subdomain enumeration.
- Reports and data analysis to identify weak points in target systems.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with the tools and scripts in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recon-workspace.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**:

   ```bash
   cd recon-workspace
   ```

3. **Install any required dependencies** (if applicable, based on the tools used):

   ```bash
   # For example, if using Python:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure any tools** as per the instructions provided in individual directories or tool documentation.

## Usage

This workspace is designed for security professionals and researchers familiar with network reconnaissance. Below is an example of how to use the scripts within this repository:

```bash
# Running a subdomain enumeration script
python subdomain_enum.py --target example.com
```

For detailed usage of each tool and script, please refer to the respective documentation within the repository.
